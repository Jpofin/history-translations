# How can I translate OAS History?

Take a look at cl_english.lua (this will always be the most up to date), create a copy and
rename it to your language in ENGLISH.  For example, if you were to create a German translation
you would name your file cl_german.lua NOT cl_deutsch.lua.

The first few lines in cl_english are special: 

```lua
---- INTERNAL
-- used only for changing languages
-- and displaying current language
thisLanguage            = "English",
thisLanguageShort       = "EN",
```

thisLanguage should be the name of the language IN that language.  English, Dansk, Nederlands,
Deutsch, Fran√ßais etc.

thisLanguageShort should be the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code for your country.  Please look
up this for your langauge if you don't know what it is.
